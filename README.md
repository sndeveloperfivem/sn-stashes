FiveM Stash Creation & Management System ESX & QBCore

A modern and lightweight stash creation system for FiveM, designed to simplify the management of storage points across your server. Built with Lua, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this resource provides an intuitive in-game admin panel that allows staff to create, configure, and manage stash locations in real time.
